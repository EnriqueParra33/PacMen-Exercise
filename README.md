# PacMen-Exercise

## Description

In this project you can create Pac-Men at a click of a button, it spawns at a random place and it has a starting velocity. When you click the *start game* button it will start moving and bouncing at the walls.

## How to run

1. See it run: <a href="https://enriqueparra33.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/">PAC-MEN</a>.
2. Click the green *Code* button and download ZIP.
3. Unzip the files in your computer. 
4. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
5. Have fun with it.

## Roadmap of future improvements

The next steps in this project will be to add styling using CSS and to improve the collisions of each Pac-Man to make them detect the other Pac-Men and change direction.
